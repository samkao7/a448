1) find GOES 16 image with lots of contrails
2) Use GOES package to get netcdf ABI image with 12.3 and 10.4 micron wavelenghts
3) find the BTD to identify ship tracks
4) Download the ERA 40 reanalysis for that day and time
5) plot RH, Temp, shear at flightlevel
6) loop

Got GOES-16 data downloaded for July 27th and plotted around Atlanta
Need to figure out which bands and colour compositions to plot to view contrails
Also need to find what time/conditions is needed for most contrails to be visible
